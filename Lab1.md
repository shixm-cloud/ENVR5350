## 1. Carbon Cycle

In this assgnment, we will explore simulation data (distributed in class) from the C4MIP. You are requited to look at the following paper to understand the background of the data.

### Problem 1 CO<sub>2</sub> variability and Temperature 

First, let's explore the spatial and temporal variability of the data of CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. You need to answer the following questions after your analysis.
* _In each of four seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON), what latitudes exhibit lowest concentration of CO<sub>2</sub>?_
* _The data are from one of the Tier 1 experiments mentioned in Jones et al. 2016, can tell which one we are analyzing, `1pctCO2-gbc` or `esm-ssp585`?
