## 1. Carbon Cycle

This is the first class of our coding lecture series. We will learn some basics about MATLAB today.

MATLAB is a software for scientific computing. The name stands for _matrix laboratory_. It can handle simple arithmetic calculations like those your scientific calculator can do, as well as complex machine learning algorithms that aids the design of BMW automobiles.

Next, let's take a look at the sofeware interface first (_Lecturer show MATLAB on the computer ..._)
