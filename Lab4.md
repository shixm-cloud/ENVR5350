## 4. Available Potential Energy

In this exercise, we will look at how avaiable potential energy (APE) resonds to global warming by examining simulations using the Commumunity Earth System Model (CESM). 

### Problem 1. Mean Lapse Rate

Two Southern Hemisphere temperature datasets are provided. One is `historical` simulation for 1897 to 1899, and the other is the simulation of 2097-2099 under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. Please complete the code below and answer the following question,
* _Do you think the mean lapse rate for the warmed climate and the current climate are significantly different? How large error (in terms of percentage) may be introduced by using the mean lapse rate profile for 1897-1899 in estimating the APE of 2097-2099?_
