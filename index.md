## Welcome 

This website hosts the coding assignments of the course Introduction to Climate Dynamics. A data analysis component is added to this course because hands-on exercies are the best way to get familier with climate concept and climate models. 

Sample code on this website is written in MATLAB. However, you are welcome to use other languages, such as Python or Julia, to finish your homework assignments.
