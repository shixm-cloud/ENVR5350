## 2. Kinetic Energy

In this exercise, you will compute and compare the kinetic energy in the mean flow, stationary waves, and transient eddies. You will also look at the impact of global warming on the circulation.

The dataset provided are daily data of zonal wind (`ua`) and meridional wind (`va`) in the simulation of 1900 and 2100 (under SSP5) climate by the GFDL climate model. They are downloaded from CMIP6 website. For your reference, the change in global mean surface temperature is **3.8** K from 1900 to 2100.

### Problem 1. Zonal Mean, Time Mean Zonal Wind

Finish the code below and compare the plots of zonally averaged, time mean zonal wind field for 1900 and 2100. You should plot the mean zonal wind in a latitude-height(pressure) coordinate. Answer the following questions:
* At what pressure level do you see the _tropospheric_ jet streams?
* Compare the figure for 1900 and that for 2100, do you see any change in the tropospheric jet streams?


### Problem 2. Stationary Waves
{% include mathjax.html %}

Complet the code below so that you can obtain maps of stationary waves. You are supposed to plot the 250hPa stationary wave wind vectors (\(\overline{u}^*\) and \(\overline{v}^*\)) on a longitude-latitude map.
